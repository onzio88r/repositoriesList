Git issue :

About a little issue on git, to retrieve the data for "collaborators_url" finally I use the same data but with the result from "contributors_url", to avoid wasting time to fix the issue

I tried to configure the access token on git request, but the response from the call was :


url request : https://api.github.com/repos/xing/amiando/collaborators?access_token=a5ff8039cf1fdb4046fd77ad1e3c59e8e73ab439

Response :

{
"message": "Must have push access to view repository collaborators.",
"documentation_url": "https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/#list-collaborators"
}
